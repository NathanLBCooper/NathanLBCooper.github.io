An old audio recording/blog post from a brown bag talk I gave at Solidsoft: [Introduction to Git-tfs](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/introduction-git-tfs-nathan-cooper)

A 15 minute talk at work about git-tfs. I introduce the basic concepts and demonstrate how to get some of the advantages of git when working with legacy TFS source control.
